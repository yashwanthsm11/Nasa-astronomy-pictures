Overview:
The NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APoD) Web App is an interactive platform designed to showcase the daily astronomical images and accompanying descriptions provided by NASA. Built using React and CSS, this web application enables users to explore and appreciate a vast array of celestial phenomena captured by space missions and observatories. By leveraging the NASA API, the app provides a rich and educational experience, allowing users to view pictures and learn about the universe on any given date.

1.Component Creation: React components are developed to handle various parts of the application, such as image display, description text, and date.
2.Styling: CSS is implemented to style the application according to the design specifications, ensuring responsiveness and visual appeal.
3. API Integration (Data Fetching): The app is integrated with the NASA API to retrieve images and descriptions. API calls are made to fetch data based on user-selected dates.
